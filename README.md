# Incident Report Analysis


## Summary

The organization experienced a DDoS attack that disrupted internal network services for two hours. The attack involved a flood of ICMP packets overwhelming the network. The incident management team responded by blocking incoming ICMP packets and restoring critical network services. Investigation revealed that an unconfigured firewall allowed the attack, prompting the implementation of new firewall rules, source IP address verification, network monitoring software, and an IDS/IPS system. This event underscores the need for enhanced network security measures to prevent future attacks and ensure the integrity of the company's network infrastructure.

## Incident Phases

| Phase     | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Identify  | The identification process involved a comprehensive audit of internal networks, systems, devices, and access privileges. Every aspect was meticulously examined to identify potential vulnerabilities and gaps in security. The critical finding was an unconfigured firewall allowing ICMP traffic to overwhelm the network. |
| Protect   | To protect the organization post-attack, several measures were implemented: a new firewall rule to limit incoming ICMP packets, source IP address verification, deployment of network monitoring software, and integration of an IDS/IPS system to filter out suspicious ICMP traffic. |
| Detect    | The attack was detected through network monitoring software that enabled real-time observation and analysis of traffic patterns. The IDS/IPS system identified and filtered out the suspicious ICMP traffic, indicating a DDoS attack. |
| Respond   | Immediate measures included blocking incoming ICMP packets, temporarily taking non-critical network services offline, and restoring critical services. A new firewall rule and source IP verification were implemented to strengthen defenses. |
| Recover   | Recovery efforts involved a thorough assessment of the damage, meticulous inspection of affected systems, and a comprehensive restoration plan. Systems were restored using backup data, with continuous monitoring to ensure the integrity of restored systems. |

## Learning Outcomes

This project applies the NIST cybersecurity framework in a practical scenario, providing insights into real-world challenges in cybersecurity incident response. It serves as a valuable educational tool for cybersecurity professionals and students, illustrating effective strategies for incident management and recovery.
